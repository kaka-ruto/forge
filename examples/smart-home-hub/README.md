4. Runs local automations for reliability
5. Offers web and mobile access
6. Maintains privacy and security

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create the smart home hub project
forge new smart-home-hub --template=iot --arch=arm

# Navigate to the project
cd smart-home-hub

# Add smart home packages
forge add package home-assistant
forge add package mosquitto
forge add package zigbee2mqtt
forge add package rhasspy

# Add connectivity features
forge add feature web-dashboard
forge add feature auto-updates
forge add feature monitoring

# Configure devices (edit forge.yml)
# - Set up Zigbee network
# - Configure voice assistant
# - Set up automations

# Build the smart home system
forge build

# Test locally
forge test --port 8123

# Deploy to Raspberry Pi
forge deploy remote --host 192.168.1.100 --user pi
```

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4 or equivalent ARM board
- 8GB+ microSD card
- Zigbee USB adapter (CC2652 or similar)
- Microphone and speaker for voice control
- Ethernet connection
- Power supply

## Configuration

### Home Assistant Setup

The hub comes pre-configured with Home Assistant:

```yaml
home_assistant:
  port: 8123
  auth_required: true
  username: "admin"
  password: "home123"
```

Access at: http://hub-ip:8123

### Zigbee Network

Local Zigbee connectivity for devices:

```yaml
zigbee:
  adapter: "cc2652"
  port: "/dev/ttyACM0"
  pan_id: "0x1a62"
  channel: 11
```

### Voice Assistant

Local voice control with Rhasspy:

```yaml
voice:
  assistant: "rhasspy"
  wake_word: "hey computer"
  language: "en"
```

### Device Integration

Pre-configured device types:

```yaml
integrations:
  - name: "lights"
    platform: "zigbee"
    devices:
      - name: "Living Room Light"
        ieee_address: "0x00124b0014c2f1a1"
```

## Expected Performance

- **Build Time**: < 45 minutes
